# Code-Examples
These are some code samples of a personal project made using Torque2D and the files are made from TorqueScript.
It shows the Arena file for the main playing field and then the base ToolNode file for the weapons or 'tools' to use.
Also there is a folder with the components for an example Blade tool.

This is a small sample of the project.
